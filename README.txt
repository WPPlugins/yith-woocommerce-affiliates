* When a user visits the store with a refer ID in query string, the plugin saves the affiliate ID and credits commissions to him/her if this visit turns into purchase

* You can credit commissions only to affiliates that have registered and have been enabled correctly
* You can create new affiliates directly from users registered to your site
* You can use a shortcode to allow affiliate registration
* You can set a general commission for affiliates for each order coming from their refer ID
* Commission status changes automatically each time order status changes
* The plugin manages automatically all totals concerning affiliates and updates them according to the status of commissions and orders
* The plugin calculates automatically refunds and decrements the total of affiliate commissions in case of refunds
* You can register payments that have to be made to affiliates
* You can handle basic reports that can be filtered by date
* You can customise parameters for the cookies managed by the plugin
* Affiliates can access their own dashboard, where they find all information about sales trend
